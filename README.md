### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is MathÃ©o and I'm 21!
I'm computer science **student** and here is my personal and school work.  

## ðŸŒŒ About me

I love **programmation** since I'm 11. Development has always been a means of self-expression.  
My creativity is also reflected through video editing and audiovisual.
But I also love lots of other things like _space_, _video games_ and more! 
I want to work in areas that fascinate me (and this is already the case with IT development).
